          includes: offering products for sale, processing payments, shipping
          and fulfillment of your order, and keeping you up to date on new

        </p>

        <h4>Lawful basis</h4>
        <p>
          Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), if you
          are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we process your
          personal information under the following lawful bases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your consent;</li>
          <li>The performance of the contract between you and the Site;</li>
          <li>Compliance with our legal obligations;</li>
          <li>To protect your vital interests;</li>
          <li>To perform a task carried out in the public interest;</li>
          <li>
            For our legitimate interests, which do not override your fundamental
            rights and freedoms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Retention</h4>
        <p>

          Information for our records unless and until you ask us to erase this

        <h4>Automatic decision-making</h4>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to
          processing based solely on automated decision-making (which includes
          profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect on you or
          otherwise significantly affects you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We [DO/DO NOT] engage in fully automated decision-making that has a
          legal or otherwise significant effect using customer data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our processor Shopify uses limited automated decision-making to
          prevent fraud that does not have a legal or otherwise significant
          effect on you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Services that include elements of automated decision-making include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Temporary denylist of IP addresses associated with repeated failed
            transactions. This denylist persists for a small number of hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temporary denylist of credit cards associated with denylisted IP
            addresses. This denylist persists for a small number of days.
          </li>
